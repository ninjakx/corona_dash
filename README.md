## Data:
Data have been fetched from [https://api.covid19india.org/](COVID19-India API)

## Visualization:
They were using google analytics charts so I have ported all the graphs to d3/dc starting from the scratch and have added more functionality to it.

Works best on Desktop/Tablet. 

## Acknowledgement:

Note: There may be some bugs which are overlooked by me. Being a non web dev this is the best I can do :blush:


### Feel free to contribute.

Edit: Since there are some changes made in the api. So some of the functionalities won't work including hover info box and filter by label on map.
